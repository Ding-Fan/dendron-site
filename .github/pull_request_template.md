- [ ] Check rendered output to ensure formatting is correct for renderings of wikilinks, note refs, tables, and images. `Dendron: Show Preview` can be used in your workspace to confirm the page renders as expected. Sometimes, `Dendron: Reload Index` needs to be ran if certain wikilinks aren't working as expected. (ignore this if contribution is made via the `Edit this page on GitHub` button from the published site)
- [ ] If this PR includes any refactoring (renaming notes, renaming headers, etc.), make sure that these changes were done via [Dendron Refactoring Commands](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/srajljj10V2dl19nCSFiC/). This will ensure that any other impacted areas of the documentation, that link to or embed modified notes (via note references), are automatically updated.
