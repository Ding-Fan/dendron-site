## Summary
This note goes over how and why we _**prune and repot**_ our past notes.

## Details

> "To gain knowledge, add things every day; to gain wisdom, subtract things every day." - Lao Tzu

- When _**pruning and repotting**_, each team member goes through everything added to the workspace to keep the workspace in order and prioritize our goals.
- We _**prune out**_ notes and ideas in order to promote new growth.
- We _**repot**_ ideas that have grown out of their existing shells to a suitable location where they could thrive.
