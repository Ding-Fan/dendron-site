#### self contained vaults

We launched self contained vaults in early preview this past month. This lets you work with vaults without the need of a workspace.

If you'd like to participate in our early preview, please fill out this [survey](https://airtable.com/shr0cwk0a9tujeipZ). We'll send you special instructions, and you'll be added to #early-preview on our Discord where we'll offer support and hold discussions.

#### Notes

- VScode has its own concept of local history. Supported at 1.66 version
- fast hover
	- can be triggered with a keyboard shortcut
	- by default it is not bind to anything
	- VS code also has a way of peeking into the note. Peeking is seeing the raw note and then 

  hovering is seeing the previous version of the note.

#### Q&A

- For questions, please add your @{discord-handle}: question
- @kevins8: how do I ask questions on the google doc? (example)

_Notes around questions asked during office hours_
- @Slaytanical#9737: will we be able to take like a current hierarchy and use it as the basis for a "new" self-contained vault? like split it off?

**_Ans: Yes. You can actually do that today by creating a new vault with the help of Vault Add command in Dendron._**
