Dendron 0.88 has sprouted  üå± ^71zw33gw6mli

<!-- [[Release Highlights|dendron://dendron.handbook/area.product.sop.release-highlights]] -->

**Self Contained Vaults:** 
We are continuing to add features to self contained vaults as part of the early preview process. Self contained vaults let you use and share your Dendron vaults without the need of a workspace. 

If you'd like to participate in our early preview, please fill out this [survey](https://airtable.com/shr0cwk0a9tujeipZ). We'll send you special instructions, and you'll be added to `#early-preview` on our Discord where we'll offer support and hold discussions. 

- More information: ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.vaults.self-contained##configuration]]) 

**Deprecation Notice:**
- We will be focusing on improving Tree view V1 and will be removing V2 in the near future. The [[enableWebUI|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config#enablewebui]] feature flag will also be removed.

## Highlights
- enhance(workspace): initialize workspace can create self contained vaults 
- deprecate(views): tree view V2 and enableWebUI feature flag will be removed in the near future

## Everything Else
- enhance(workspace): improve the error message for bad or missing code-workspace file 
- enhance(common): don't reload workspace when running doctor airtable command
- fix(workspace): fix dropped keystrokes issue in lookup
- fix(internal): Engine `updateNote` not properly firing update events
- fix(markdown): support parenthesis in the image URL
- fix(views): Backlinks will no longer disappear in preview upon editing
- fix(lookup): autocomplete causes notes to be created in wrong vault
- fix(views): Preview now works in remote workspaces
