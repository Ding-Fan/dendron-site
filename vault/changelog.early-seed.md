> This page documents the features, enhancements, and fixes in the latest early seed release. The early seed is a preview of the weekly release, so you'll see the next minor version when installing (ex. `0.78.0` instead of `0.77.1`). When dendron ships the general release, the currently installed extension will automatically be updated (but will still have same version).

## 0.94.0

Dendron 0.94 has sprouted ðŸŒ±

**Go To:** We've added a `Go To` command to help support navigating to different types of links in Dendron. Now, Dendron will respond appropriately when navigating to a note, markdown link or [[Proxy note|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.special-notes#proxy-notes]].

- More information: [[Go To Command|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands.goto]]

**Graph Themes: ** It's time your graph got a facelift! You can now choose between 3 graph themes: Block, Classic and Monokai, or create your own custom theme styled to your liking. 

- More information: [[Graph Themes|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.graph-view.md#graph-theme]]

**Help and Feedback Panel**
We're rolling out a new Panel in VSCode to give you convenient access to our starting guide and documentation, as well as a direct way to give us feedback. Check it out!
