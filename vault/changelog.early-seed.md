> This page documents the features, enhancements, and fixes in the latest early seed release. The early seed is a preview of the weekly release, so you'll see the next minor version when installing (ex. `0.78.0` instead of `0.77.1`). When dendron ships the general release, the currently installed extension will automatically be updated (but will still have same version).

## 0.88.0

### Enhancements
- enhance(workspace): improve the error message for bad or missing code-workspace file (#2600) @kaan
- enhance(workspace): initialize workspace can create self contained vaults ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.vaults.self-contained##configuration]]) (#2569) @kaan



### Fix
- fix(workspace): fix dropped keystrokes issue in lookup (#2626) @jonathan
