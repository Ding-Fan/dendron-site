> This page documents the features, enhancements, and fixes in the latest early seed release. The early seed is a preview of the weekly release, so you'll see the next minor version when installing (ex. `0.78.0` instead of `0.77.1`). When dendron ships the general release, the currently installed extension will automatically be updated (but will still have same version).

## 0.92.0

Dendron 0.92 has sprouted ðŸŒ±

**Graph View**: We've improved the loading speed of the graph view. You should notice a drastic improvement in load times-up to 100x in larger workspaces ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€.

**Tree View**: We've improved the stability of the tree view and fixed an error with `Dendron: Rename Note` that caused the tree view to fall out of sync. 

**Self Contained Vaults**: You can now move self contained vaults between local and remote locations using the `Dendron: Vault Convert` command. 

- More information can be found in our [[documentation on vaults|dendron.topic.vaults#vault-convert]]
