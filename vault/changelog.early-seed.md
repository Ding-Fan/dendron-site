> This page documents the features, enhancements, and fixes in the latest early seed release. The early seed is a preview of the weekly release, so you'll see the next minor version when installing (ex. `0.78.0` instead of `0.77.1`). When dendron ships the general release, the currently installed extension will automatically be updated (but will still have same version).

## 0.91.0

Dendron 0.91 has sprouted ðŸŒ±

**Note Title Configuration**: This release introduces a configuration setting to allow notes to display their full hierarchy in their note title. For example, if this setting is enabled, a new note named `one.two.three` will be titled  `One Two Three`.

**Go to Assets**: We've expanded functionality for file assets in Dendron. For wikilinks that link to non-note files, `Dendron: Go to Note` and `Go to Definition` will now open them using your OS default app.
