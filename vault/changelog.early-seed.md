> This page documents the features, enhancements, and fixes in the latest early seed release. The early seed is a preview of the weekly release, so you'll see the next minor version when installing (ex. `0.78.0` instead of `0.77.1`). When dendron ships the general release, the currently installed extension will automatically be updated (but will still have same version).

**Vault-Level URLs**: We're improving the experience with published vaults. Vaults can now be configured with their own URL. These URLs will be used when copying or exporting notes, replacing wikilinks with the correct URL for the vault.
