## Summary

Every week, we'll pin a staff favorite in the `#teatime` channel to help seed discussion and share something that has caught our eye. Community members can submit links for the Dendron Reading Series and earn a Discord [[Scout|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord.roles#scout]] role.

## Submissions

Interested in submitting an article you read? You only need to provide a link, and up to a few paragraphs on what you thought about it.

For an example:
- [[8 - Vienna's museums are moving their censored nude images to OnlyFans|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.reading-series.2021.11.23]]
