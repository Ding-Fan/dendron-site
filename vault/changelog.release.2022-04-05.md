#### Derek Sendoff

If you've checked out our Discord, you've probably come across Derek, our product evangelist. Derek is transitioning from his role as evangelist to community member and has the following words to share. If you have words you want to share, you can reply to  [Derek's sendoff thread in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/892453144632627200/960908495614513182).

Hey! I'm Derek, also known as ScriptAutomate here in Discord and other social channels. I may have helped you with an onboarding session, answered some questions in an Office Hours, or helped with publishing your Dendron notes to the world. I wanted to take a moment to announce that I'm transitioning from a full-time team member to a community member, and to reflect on my time on the Dendron team.
>
I met Kevin Lin at a WriteTheDocs Meetup a few years ago, in Seattle, where he showed me an early version of Dendron. I was blown away. When Dendron was open sourced, and became a company, I wanted to jump in. I could see all the potential!
>
I was working on Salt Project, at VMware, before I joined Dendron. I worked in a unique role that was a combination of SRE and Technical Writer in open source projects. I love open source, and I knew that if I were to work somewhere else in a full-time role, it would need to be part of that world.
>
I wanted to help Dendron succeed, and share the power of it with others, so I took the leap and jumped in as a Dendron Evangelist last year.
>
Some big draws for me, about Dendron, were:
- Multi-vault: Being able to treat knowledge bases as plugins, especially with the initial version of Seeds. I'm looking forward to what vaults the community will continue to produce and create.
- Publishing: Publishing notes/documentation from multiple projects was a problem I ran into quite a bit with technical docs pipelines.
- Refactoring superpowers: Update all of your internal links, automatically, whenever you update your note names, hierarchies, and headers. This saves a lot of work whenever redesigning the structure of your notes.
- Asynchronous meetings, and everything written somewhere: The Dendron team runs in a unique fashion, avoiding meeting hell and making sure we document everything we are working on. This was a new way of working for me, and I loved it.
>
That's just a snapshot. Dendron reminded me of what pop was doing in Python, approaching development as plugin-oriented knowledge from the start. The idea of pulling down vaults of knowledge, related to your favorite subjects and tools, directly into your own personal knowledge base like lego pieces was something I hadn't seen before. I want to work toward making it a norm.
>
There are many things I'm interested in doing that include Dendron, and I want to make use of it wherever I can. I feel that I can serve Dendron well, as a community member, as I move forward to work on other content creation and open source projects (which will continue to include Dendron!) üå±
