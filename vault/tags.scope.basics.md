Think of this as a horizontal category that picks out the simplest functionality in each scope that is most likely to be used by a customer in their first two weeks. 

VS Code workspace, vaults, intellisense/autocomplete, Dendron settings

## Examples

- validating settings on startup
- opening a file
- autocomplete works for note linking (test vault with at least 100 notes)
- remote vault add

## Sub-scopes

- #scope.basics.workspace

## Features

1. #feature.lookup
2. #feature.hierarchy
3. #feature.markdown
4. #feature.asset-support
5. #feature.links
8. #feature.templates
9. #feature.daily-journal
10.#feature.workbench
11.#feature.vaults

##  Extension scopes
Since the basics scope only covers what a typical customer would do in two weeks, more functionality related to each vertical can be categorized under the following scopes: 

- Lookup -> #scope.retrieve.note-lookup
- Hierarchies -> #scope.structure
- Markdown -> #scope.edit
- Images -> #feature.asset-support
- Links -> #scope.navigate
- Note references -> #scope.retrieve (#feature.note-refs)
- Templates -> #scope.structure (#feature.templates)
- Workbench -> #scope
