## Summary

Scopes track common areas of functionality in Dendron. 

There are broadly speaking, two types of scopes:
- vertical scopes track a specific area of functionality
- horizontal scopes track a common property across multiple verticals

Some scopes have sub-scopes that go into more specific functionality.
