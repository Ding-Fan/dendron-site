Dendron 0.91 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

**Meeting Notes**: We're introducing a new type of special note: **meeting notes**. Meeting notes help you quickly create meeting-specific notes by applying a customizable template. Try them out with the `Dendron: Create Meeting Note` command!

- More information [[in our documentation on special notes|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.special-notes#meeting-note]]

**Note Title Configuration**: This release introduces a configuration setting to allow notes to display their full hierarchy in their note title. For example, if this setting is enabled, a new note named `one.two.three` will be titled  `One Two Three`.

- More information [[in our documentation on workspace configuration|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config.workspace#enablefullhierarchynotetitle]]

**Opening Assets**: We've expanded functionality for file assets in Dendron. For wikilinks that link to non-note files, `Dendron: Go to Note` and `Go to Definition` will now open them using your OS default app.
