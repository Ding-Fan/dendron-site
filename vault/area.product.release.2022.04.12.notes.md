**Vault-Level URLs**: We're improving the experience with published vaults. Vaults can now be configured with their own URL. These URLs will be used when copying or exporting notes, replacing wikilinks with the correct URL for the vault. 

## Highlights
- feature(publish): support custom urls for vaults

## Everything Else
- enhance(publish): open published tree view links in new tab
- fix(workspace): error when adding a self contained vault inside a native workspace
- fix(publish): publish issues with latest version of nextjs due to swc module
- fix(workspace): preserve wikilink metadata on export 
- fix(workspace): typo "hierarchy", "should" 
- fix(workspace): consistent tree item sort order
