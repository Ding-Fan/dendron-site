Dendron 0.79 has sprouted  üå±

Are you interested in using a logo for your website without needing to include it in the local repository? Now you can publish by referencing a URL (`https://example.com/logo.png`) in your `dendron.yml` configs.

When creating new notes, in multi-vault workspaces, `confirmVaultOnCreate` now defaults to `true`. We've added another config option where you can have Dendron _always_ prompt where a new note should exist with `vaultSelectionModeOnCreate`.

Breaking change: A fix in this release will disable [date variable substitution](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/861cbdf8-102e-4633-9933-1f3d74df53d2.html#template-variables), so current users will not be able to use it for the time being.

### Highlights
- enhance(publish): logo can reference a full URL path to external image ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.publish.faq#how-do-i-add-a-logo-to-my-website]]) 
- enhance(lookup): add configuration for vault selection behavior with new `vaultSelectionModeOnCreate` config option, and change `confirmVaultOnCreate` default to `true` ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config.commands#vaultselectionmodeoncreate]])
- enhance(publish): attempt to update Next.js template in-place
- enhance(publish): add lockfile to Next.js

### Everything Else
- fix(server): highlighting breaks when there's too much text
- fix(workspace): stop link candidate logic when disabled
- fix(commands): renamed command from `Goto Note` to `Go to Note`
- fix(markdown): Exclude parenthesis from tags
- fix(publish): logo doesn't respect assetsPrefix
- fix(workspace): cursor moves to top when opening file through the search
- fix(schema): Use string replace instead of lodash for date variable substitution (breaking change)
- fix(publish): some published pages will show error
