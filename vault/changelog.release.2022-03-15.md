Dendron 0.86 has sprouted  üå±

The Airtable Export Pod now supports null entries for dates. Before this, an empty/null value for date would prompt issues when attempting to export notes to Airtable. Learn more here: ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.pod-v2.ref.builtin.airtable.export#date]]) 

In addition, we've improved the speed of note references - you should notice a significantly faster experience when using note references and hover previews. 

This release includes a variety of other fixes and improvements.

## Highlights
- enhance(pods): support null entries for dates in Airtable export pod v2 
- enhance(basics): improve performance around reference rendering including hover

## Everything Else
- enhance(workspace): Dendron still loads if there's a missing local vault
- fix(pods): Google Docs Export pod displays Bad Request error on export
- fix(publish): better error messages when publishing
- fix(views): block anchors showing up in the preview
- fix(basics): ensure note title is always a string to avoid errors (#2551) @kaan

- ‚≠ê `mikhail#3816` shared a link to [dendron-citations](https://github.com/mivanit/dendron-citations): _" I've put out a major update to dendron-citations. Now, tag notes are automatically created for each keyword and author -- this lets you use dendron backlinks to see which papers a certain author has written, or which papers have a certain keyword! I've also put out a lot of other minor improvements.
